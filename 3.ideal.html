						<h1>Ideal Job</h1>
						<span class="image main"><img src="images/job.jpg" alt="" /></span>
						<p><b>What is my ideal job?</b><br>My ideal job can be found <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/36939664?type=standard">here.</a>
							<br>If the link is expired, you can find the <a href="6. job-description.html">screenshot here.	</a></p>
						<p><b>What is this job about and why does it appeal to me?</b><br>I'm really interested in this position as you will be placed into the IT branch of the business and you'll be asked to solve problems that will help other parts of the business. As a Business Analyst, I'll be trying to tackle different varieties of problems, so there's always something new and interesting to do. This job will require me (and who ever is on the same project team) to implement a IT solutions in a cost-effective way. And, also determine the requirements of the project, and communicate them clearly to stakeholders and partners. This position is very appealing to me as you're able to communicate and collaborate with all major sectors of the business to create something that will help make their work easier. And you'll also meet a lot of people too, which I like as I am a social person, or I think myself out to be.</p>
						<p><b>What are the requirements for this position?</b><br>This position mainly requires you to have previous (5+ years) experience as a business anaylst. And, from this previous experience, you'll have matched the other requirements for the roles such as defining solutions and design, influential role and maybe Asset Management. And like most business analyst jobs, it does require you to have a Bachelor of Information Technology degree.</p>
						<p><b>What are the skills, qualification and experiences that I currently hold?</b><br>My currently hold a RSA and RSG, and my current experiences are more orientated at the hospitality industry. I believe its one of the best fields to work in as a student as its low stakes and low risk. And, I'm going to stick with hospitality until I complete my degree. I worked at cafe and gained many skills such as barista, cash handling, POS, customer services, team and many more. I also volunteered at RMIT for the student union and also for Open Day. Here, I gained customer experience skills as I am talking to a large scale of potential students and explain why I chose to study at RMIT. I also worked at DOMINO's as pump bike rider when I was younger, and I learned to make pizza, bike riding safety and customer service at the door.</p>
						<p><b>What is my plan so that I will be able to reach the requirements for the role in the future?</b><br>My plan is the graduate out of my degree (BP162) as soon as possible. This will require me to do full time classes and do summer/winter classes over the break. From this degree, I will gain variety of skills such as programming, IT, business etc. And I'll need to major in Business. And after graduation, I will start looking for a Junior Business Analyst position in an IT branch. And from here, I need to learn about how the business function and what kind of problems it faces. And it will be upto me to solve these IT related problems. Hardwork and positivity hopefully help me keep the position and maybe even get promoted. And after working at the company for over 5 years, I can finally apply for the desired role.</p>
